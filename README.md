# FINE3300-2025-A1
This repository contains my solutions for the FINE 3300 Assignment 1. It consists of two Python programs that demonstrate the application of financial mathematics and currency conversion through object-oriented programming. The first file, labelled "mortgage.py", defines a class (MortgagePayment) that is able to calculate periodic mortgage payments under different schedules, these being weekly, rapid weekly, bi-weekly, rapid bi-weekly, monthly, and semi-monthly. Users are able to provide inputs such as the principal, quoted annual interest rate, and amortization period, and the Python program will output each payment type in an organized format. The second file, labelled "exchange_rates.py", defines a class (ExchangeRates) that reads the Bank of Canada's exchange rate CSV file and converts amounts between CAD and USD using the latest listed exchange rate. Users will be able to input the amount they wish to convert and can choose between inputting CAD or USD amounts. These files showcase how Python can be used to solve financial problems through the use of user inputs, class designs, and formatted outputs. Additionally, this work demonstrates the use of GitHub for version control as well as project organization.
